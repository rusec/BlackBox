Password manager
A little CLI application that utilizes SSH to change and manage passwords for a network of computers. The application stores reset passwords in an encrypted file, which gets stored on the user's computer.

Workflow
On initiation, the password manager will ask you to create a master password. Password must be longer than 8 characters. This will be the password used to get in from now on  
Create a computers.csv file that looks something like this
Once all the computers you'd like are set, click Load CSV on the main menu
After CSV is loaded, you will see all the computers under Edit Computers, where you can change each listed computer's passwords, usernames, and OS.
